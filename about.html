				<h1>What is Pathfinders?</h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="in-content">
					<p>
						Pathfinders is a fun, social and hands-on way to learn new skills and discover the world God created for us. Children aged 10 to 15 years can attend 
						camping trips where experienced, qualified volunteers will teach them survival skills, camping craft and help them discover the exciting wonders of the 
						outdoors.
						<br>
						<br>
						Engaging lessons give the children an opportunity to learn about crafts and hobbies, as well as offering them a taste of future professions the children may 
						one day like to pursue. Pathfinders has a focus on service with many clubs involved with a wide range of community service activities.
						<br>
						Pathfinders can earn "honours" which are badges awarded on completion of certain objectives. Some honours have practical activities that need to be completed, 
						including camping, tramping, cake decorating, puppet making, soap cutting, and many many more. There are almost endless possibilities for what can be learnt and 
						achieved in Pathfinders.
						<br>
						Along with honours, children also have the opportunity to achieved a range of other Pathfinder awards both for themselves and their club.
						<br>
						<br>
						Most Seventh-day Adventist churches have a Pathfinder Club your child can join. Clubs usually meet for monthly meetings on a Saturday and/or Sunday. 
						Pathfinders is a place where your child can learn about God and make life-long friendships, learn practical skills and develop the confidence that comes 
						with the success of achieving new things.

				<h1>The origins and history of Pathfinders</h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="in-content">
					<p>
						Pathfinders originated from the desire of parents who wanted the best opportunities for their children to grow in all aspects of life. 
						They wanted them to have opportunities to mature in their spiritual life while gaining outdoor skills from how to build a fire and orienteering in the bush.
						<br>
						<br>
						Originally, Pathfinders was called Missionary Volunteers (MV) and then Junior Missionary Volunteers (JMV), these started in 1907 and 1909.
						<br>
						The class groups (now known as Friends, Companions, Rangers, Explorers, Voyagers, Guides and Master Guides) started as Friend, Companion, Comrade and Master 
						Comrade in 1922.
						<br>
						Honours (then known as "Merits") were introduced in 1928.
						<br>
						Eventually, the term Pathfinders was introduced in 1929. 						
						<br>
						<br>
						Over the next four years the basic Pathfinder traditions were developed such as choosing the name Pathfinders, shield, flag, original song and original pledge 
						and law.
						<br>
						The General Conference approved the organisation in 1950 and it was subsequently introduced to the world, although unofficial clubs started being formed in New Zealand 
						around 1940.
						<br>
						Bishopdale Pathfinders started in approximarely 1971, and was being operated out of a family workshop out in Springston. When the original hall of Bishopdale 
						Seventh-Day Adventist Church was built in 1973, Pathfinders operated out of the church.
