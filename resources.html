				<h1>The Pathfinder Uniform</h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="in-content">
					<p>
						The Pathfinder Club has an internationally recognised uniform, even though there are global variations. The core elements are emblems, scarf and sash. 
                        It is symbolic of the ideals of Pathfinders. Each time it is worn, it represents the organisation, the Church, and God. The uniform should be neat and clean. 
                        It should be worn with dignity. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Bishopdale Pathfinders supplies uniform in a 'library' process, where uniform is loaned out at no cost and returned when a new size is needed or a Pathfinder leaves.
                        <br>
                        See below for resources on the uniform requirements for Bishopdale Pathfinders, as well as positioning for insignia/patches.

				<h1>Pathfinder Honours</h1>

						Each honor is designed to be a course of study that introduces a subject. This subject should have practical value and should enhance the lifestyle of 
                        the person pursuing the honor. Honor study should assist the person in his/her development as a well-rounded Christian by directly affecting the social, 
                        emotional, physical, and spiritual aspects of life.

				<h1>The Pathfinder Pledge and Law</h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="in-content">
					<p>
                        The Pathfinder Pledge and Law was developed originally by Arthur W. Spalding and reflected the language of that particular time. A new version of the Pledge 
                        and Law was introduced by the South Pacific Division (SPD) in 1990 with the introduction of the Pathfinder Song.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>The Pledge</b>
                        <br>
                        Loving the Lord my God, I will
                        <br>
                        Daily seek His presence
                        <br>
                        Show friendship to others
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        <br>
                        The Pathfinder Law is for me to:
                        <br>
                        Look for good in others
                        <br>
                        Aim to do my best

                        future. The SPD Pathfinder Song was composed by Stanley Schirmer and launched at the Treasure Bend Camporee held in 1990 at Bairnsdale, Victoria.

				<h1>The Pathfinder Flag</h1>

				<div class="in-content">
                    <p>
                        The official Pathfinder flag is to be displayed by each club. The flag is rectangular in shape and is divided through the centre both vertically and horizontally 
                        making four equal parts. The background colours are royal blue and white alternately, sewn together with the upper left-hand corner being royal blue. 
                        The flag measures approximately 1m by x 1.5m in size, and the staff is 2 m long and 38cm in diameter. The name of the Pathfinder Club is displayed in the lower 
                        right quadrant using white letters. It is appropriate to display the Pathfinder flag at such occasions as Pathfinder fairs and camporees, 
                        Pathfinder day in the church, civic parades, etc.

                                <p>Gold is also used as a standard of measurement. When we listen to the news every night, the price of gold is reported, giving us the indication 
                                    that this metal is worth something. The Pathfunder club has high standards to help us build strong and worthy characters for the kingdom of God.

                                <p>White is found in the 2nd and 3rd quarter of the Pathfinder flag. White is a symbol of purity. It translates the desire to have the righteousness 
                                    of Christ's life reflected in our lives. <i>Revelation 3:5.</i></p>

                                <p>The blue is in the 1st and 4th quarter of the flag. Blue is recognised as a colour that represents loyalty. The blue in the flag reminds us that 
                                    one of the purposes of the Pathfinder club is to teach us to be loyal to our God, our country, our parents, our Church and our club.</p>
